     * scheme.  The class name reflects the fact that these objects
     * represent directed edges in the directed graph with the GCNode
     * objects as its nodes.
     *
     * Whenever an object of a type derived from GCNode needs to refer
     * to another such object, it should do so by containing a GCEdge
     * object, rather than by containing a pointer or reference
     * directly.

     *           may be qualified by const, so for example a const
     *           String* may be encapsulated in a GCEdge using the type
     *           GCEdge<const String>.
