     * DispatchOrEval() and tryDispatch() (all in eval.cpp), and in
     * such cases the \a function parameter to the constructor may be
     * null, or point to a BuiltInFunction rather than a Closure, and
     * the arguments listed by the \a promise_args parameter may not
     * actually be wrapped in Promise objects.
     *
     * @todo Regularize aberrant (i.e. non-Closure-related) uses of
     * ClosureContext.
