	/** @brief Search for an S3 method.
	 *
	 * This function searches for a definition of an S3 method
	 * bound to \a symbol.
	 *
	 * The search is first carried out in \a call_env and its
	 * enclosing environments, as in findFunction().
	 *
	 * If this fails to find a binding of \a symbol to a
	 * FunctionBase, and \a table_env is not null, the search then
	 * determines whether the Frame of \a table_env defines an S3
	 * methods table, that is to say, whether it contains a
	 * Binding of the symbol <tt>.__S3MethodsTable__.</tt> to an
	 * Environment.  If so, a Binding of \a symbol is sought in
	 * the Frame of that Environment (i.e. the Environment bound
	 * to <tt>.__S3MethodsTable__.</tt>).  If the value of the
	 * Binding is a Promise, the Promise is forced and the result
	 * of evaluating the Promise is used as part of the returned
	 * value.
	 *
	 * If, in the course of searching for a suitable Binding, a
	 * Binding of \a symbol to Symbol::missingArgument()
	 * (R_MissingArg) is encountered, an error is raised.
	 *
	 * Read/write monitors are invoked in the following
	 * circumstances: (i) If a Promise is forced, any read monitor
	 * for the relevant Binding is called before forcing it, and
	 * any write monitor for the symbol's Binding is called
	 * immediately afterwards.  (ii) If this function succeeds in
	 * finding a Binding to a FunctionBase, then any read monitor
	 * for that Binding is called.
	 *
	 * @param symbol Non-null pointer to the Symbol for which a
	 *          Binding is sought.  In practice the name of the Symbol
	 *          will be of an articulated form such as
	 *          <tt>print.lm</tt> or <tt>summary.default</tt>;
	 *          however, the function neither checks nor relies on
	 *          this.
	 *
	 * @param call_env Non-null pointer to the Environment in which
	 *          the search for a Binding is first carried out.  In
	 *          practice this will be the call Environment of the S3
	 *          generic.
	 *
	 * @param table_env Pointer, possibly null, to the Environment
	 *          in whose Frame an S3 methods table (i.e. an
	 *          Environment bound to <tt>.__S3MethodsTable__.</tt>)
	 *          is sought, if no method was found in \a call_env.
	 *          If \a table_env is null, no S3 methods table is sought.
	 *
	 * @return If a Binding to a FunctionBase was found, the first
	 * element of the pair is the value of the Binding (except
	 * that if the value was a Promise, the first element is the
	 * result of evaluating the Promise) and the second element of
	 * the pair is \c true if the Binding was found by searching
	 * in \a call_env, and \c false if it was found in the S3
	 * methods table.  If no Binding to a FunctionBase was found,
	 * the first element of the pair will be null and the second
	 * element <tt>false</tt>.
	 *
	 * @note An S3 methods table is currently sought only within
	 * the Frame of \a table_env itself; the search does not
	 * proceed to enclosing Environments.  This follows CR, but it
	 * perhaps unduly restrictive.
