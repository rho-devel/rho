     *
     * This class, all of whose members are static, encapsulates
     * services supporting subscripting of R vector objects, including
     * R matrices and arrays.  Foremost among its member functions are
     * subset() and subassign(); the other member functions are
     * auxiliary to these two.
     *
     * @todo At present this class does not handle the special case
     * (described in sec. 3.4.2 of the R Language Definition) where
     * subscripting is being applied to an array, and there is a
     * single subscript which is a matrix with as many columns as the
     * array has dimensions, each row of the matrix being used to pick
     * out a single element of the array.
     *
     * @todo A matter for possible review is the fact that during
     * subsetting and subassignment operations, rho sometimes makes
     * deep copies of vectors of RHandle objects in cases where CR
     * gets away with simple pointer copies.
     *
     * @todo CR 3 uses vectors of real numbers to represent subscripts
     * where these would be too big to fit into an INTEGER.
