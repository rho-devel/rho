    /** @brief Lightweight implementation of rho::Frame.
     *
     * This implementation is intended for Frames which might contain
     * only a small number of Bindings.  Look-up time is very fast and few
     * memory allocations are required as long as the number of bindings
     * is small.
     * For large numbers of bindings, lookups and insertions are still O(1),
     * but not as fast.
     *
     * This is implemented via a fixed-size unordered array of bindings.
     * For small sizes, the linear scan through the array is fast and cache
     * efficient.
     * If more bindings are added to the frame than the array can store,
     * the remaining bindings are added to a hashmap.  This ensures that
     * the frame can handle large numbers of bindings reasonably efficiently.
