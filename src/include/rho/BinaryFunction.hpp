	 * operand, if it has them.</li>

	 * <li>If just one operand is array, the result will be an
	 * array with the same dimensions.  Dimension names are taken
	 * from the array operand, if it has them.</li>
	 *
	 * <li>If neither operand is an array, the 'names' attribute
	 * is taken from the first operand if it has them, otherwise
	 * from the second operand, if it has them.</li>
	 *
	 * <li>If both operands are time series (in which case they
	 * must have the same parameters, i.e. start time, end time
	 * and frequency), the result will be a time series with the
	 * same parameters.  The result will take its class attribute
	 * from the first operand if it has one, otherwise from the
	 * second operand, if it has one.</li>
	 *
	 * <li>If just one operand is a time series, the result will
	 * be a time series with the same parameters.  The result from
	 * take its class attribute from the time-series operand, if
	 * it has one.</li>

	 *  void copyAttributes(VectorBase* output,
	 *                      const VectorBase* lhs, const VectorBase* rhs)
	 * which sets the attributes on \a output when called.
