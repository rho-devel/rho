     *
     * isnan() was introduced by C99, which prescribes that it shall
     * be a macro. ISO14882, even in its 2003 issue, requires only
     * that <cmath> offer the facilities of math.h as defined in
     * ISO/IEC 9899:1990.  TR1 proposed that <cmath> make isnan()
     * available to C++ programs as a templated function within the
     * std namespace.  On Linux, gcc appears to make the ordinary
     * isnan() macro available to C++ programs.  However, on Mac OS X
     * (at least as of 10.5.6) gcc appears to make isnan() available
     * to C++ programs only as std::isnan().
     *
     * The following covers these two cases.  Another possibility that
     * may need to be addressed is that C++'s isnan() is to be found
     * in namespace std::tr1.
