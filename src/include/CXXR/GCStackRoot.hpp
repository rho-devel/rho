     *
     * This class encapsulates a pointer to an object of a type
     * derived from GCNode.  For as long as the GCStackRoot object
     * exists, the GCNode that it points to will not be garbage
     * collected.
     *
     * GCStackRoot objects are intended to be allocated on the
     * processor stack: specifically, the class implementation
     * requires that GCStackRoot objects are destroyed in the reverse
     * order of creation, and the destructor checks this.
     *
     * @tparam T GCNode or a type publicly derived from GCNode.  This
     *           may be qualified by const, so for example a const
     *           String* may be encapsulated in a GCStackRoot using the
     *           type GCStackRoot<const String>.
     *
     * \par Caller protects:
     * Suppose some code calls a function (or class method) that takes
     * a pointer or reference to a class derived from GCNode as an
     * argument, and/or returns a pointer to a class derived from
     * GCNode as its return value.  In CXXR, the preferred coding
     * approach is that the \e calling \e code should take
     * responsibility for protecting the arguments from the garbage
     * collector before calling the function, and likewise take
     * responsibility for protecting the returned value.  This is
     * because the calling code is in a better position to decide
     * whether any additional steps are necessary to achieve this, and
     * what they should be.  (The calling code may also need to protect
     * other objects: objects that are neither arguments to or values
     * returned from the called function, but which would otherwise be
     * vulnerable if the called function gave rise to a garbage
     * collection.)
