/** @file config.hpp
 *
 * @brief Build configuration options specific to CXXR.
 *
 * This file contains documentation and definitions of preprocessor
 * variables that configure the behaviour of CXXR.  However, it
 * excludes preprocessor variables that are controlled by options to
 * the autoconf-generated <tt>configure</tt> script: for information
 * on these see <tt>./configure --help</tt>.
 *
 * As distributed, this file represents a configuration suitable for
 * development, with numerous facilities enable for checking and
 * debugging.  For maximum speed, it is recommended that this file be
 * modified by enabling the definitions of NDEBUG and
 * UNCHECKED_SEXP_DOWNCAST, and disabling all other definitions.

 * the preprocessor variable AGGRESSIVE_GC define, every call to

 *
 * @brief First-in first-out memory block allocation.
 *
 * By default, class CXXR::CellPool (which class CXXR::MemoryBank uses
 * to manage memory blocks smaller than 128Â bytes) operates a
 * last-in-first-out allocation policy; that is to say, if there are
 * memory blocks that have been deallocated and not yet reallocated,
 * the next one to be reallocated will be the one that was most
 * recently deallocated. This makes for efficient utilisation of the
 * processor caches. However, if CXXR is compiled with the
 * preprocessor variable CELLFIFO defined, it instead operates a
 * first-in-first-out policy. This results in a longer turnround time
 * in reallocating cells, which improves the lethality of the FILL55
 * preprocessor variable (described below) in showing up premature
 * deallocation of cells.

 * made the target of any CXXR::GCEdge, CXXR::GCRoot or

/** @def RARE_GC
 *
 * @brief Suppress reference-counting garbage collection.
 *
 * By default, CXXR will delete any CXXR::GCNode whose reference count
 * has fallen to zero as a preliminary to allocating memory for a new
 * CXXR::GCNode. Because the memory of CXXR::GCNode objects thus
 * deleted is likely to be reused almost immediately, it can be
 * difficult to identify bugs caused by premature garbage collection
 * (i.e. insufficient protection against garbage collection). In
 * particular, the FILL55 preprocessor variable is less effective in
 * this regard than it was before CXXR used reference counting.
 * Defining RARE_GC suppresses the default behaviour, and results in
 * CXXR::GCNode objects being deleted only as part of the mark-sweep
 * garbage collection process, initiated when a memory utilisation
 * threshold is exceeded. In summary, if a bug stops manifesting
 * itself when RARE_GC is defined, it is probably due to premature
 * garbage collection.

/** @def UNCHECKED_SEXP_DOWNCAST
 *
 * @brief Don't check downcasts within the CXXR::RObject class hierarchy.

 * By default, CXXR implements the templated function
 * CXXR::SEXP_downcast<PtrOut, PtrIn>() using
 * <code>dynamic_cast</code>, to verify that the argument object is of
 * an appropriate type for the requested cast. If
 * UNCHECKED_SEXP_DOWNCAST is defined, CXXR uses instead a
 * <code>static_cast</code>, i.e. it in effect assumes that the
 * downcast is legal. Not recommended during development.
