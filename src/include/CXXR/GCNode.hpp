     *
     * Abstract base class for all objects managed by the garbage
     * collector.
     *
     * \par Derived class checklist:
     * Classes derived directly or indirectly from GCNode should do
     * the following to ensure the integrity of the garbage collection
     * scheme:
     * <ol>
     * <li>Explicitly declare a destructor (even if it does nothing)
     * as either protected or (if no further derivation from the class
     * is envisaged) private.  This ensures that objects of classes
     * derived from GCNode can be created only using 'new'.</li>
     *
     * <li>If the derived class contains any pointers or references to
     * other objects derived from GCNode, these should be encapsulated
     * within an object of the templated class GCEdge, and the class
     * should reimplement the methods detachReferents() and visitReferents()
     * appropriately.  (This does not necessarily apply to pointers
     * where other logic ensures that the pointer does not outlive the
     * thing pointed to.)</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * \par Infant immunity:
     * Mark-sweep garbage collection is disabled while any GCNode or
     * object of a class derived from GCNode is under construction.
     * This greatly simplifies the coding of the constructors.  Such
     * an object is considered to be under construction from the
     * moment the constructor is invoked until the node is exposed by
     * calling the member function expose() (in one of its two forms),
     * or until the node is deleted, whichever is sooner.  It is the
     * responsibility of any code that creates an object of a class
     * derived from GCNode to ensure that the object is exposed as
     * soon as possible, e.g. before a pointer to the node is returned
     * as the value of a function.  In particular, a node must be
     * exposed before it is designated as the target of a GCEdge, a
     * GCStackRoot or a GCRoot, or protected with PROTECT() or
     * REPROTECT(): if the preprocessor variable CHECK_EXPOSURE is
     * defined, runtime checks for this are inserted into the code.
     *
     * The simplest way of ensuring timely exposure is always to wrap
     * the \c new call in a call to expose():
     * e.g. <tt>GCNode::expose(new FooNode(<i>args</i>)</tt>.  This
     * can be further simplified using the CXXR_NEW macro to
     * CXXR_NEW(FooNode).
     *
     * @note Because this base class is used purely for housekeeping
     * by the garbage collector, and does not contribute to the
     * 'meaning' of an object of a derived class, its data members are
     * mutable.
     *
     * @todo The (private) cleanup() method needs to address the
     * possibility that derived classes may have destructors that
     * release some external resource (e.g. a lock).  Maybe a garbage
     * collection without a 'mark' phase would do the trick.
