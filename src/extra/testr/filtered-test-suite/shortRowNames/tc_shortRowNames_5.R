For numeric/ordinal\\nvariables the restriction to non-zero weights is new: for\\ncategorical variables this is a new restriction.\", \"Surrogate splits which improve only by rounding error over the\\ndefault split are no longer returned.

Essentially, for the lower\\nleaves all our time used to be eaten up by bookkeeping, and this\\nwas replaced by a different approach.  The primary routine also\\nuses .Call{} so as to be more memory efficient.\", \"The other major change was an error for asymmetric loss matrices,\\nprompted by a user query.  With L=loss asymmetric, the altered\\npriors were computed incorrectly - they were using L' instead of L.\\nUpshot - the tree would not not necessarily choose optimal splits\\nfor the given loss matrix.  Once chosen, splits were evaluated\\ncorrectly.  The printed “improvement” values are of course the\\nwrong ones as well.  It is interesting that for my little test\\ncase, with L quite asymmetric, the early splits in the tree are\\nunchanged - a good split still looks good.\", \"Add the return.all argument to xpred.rpart().\", \"Added a set of formal tests, i.e., cases with known answers to\\nwhich we can compare.\", \"Add a usercode vignette, explaining how to add user defined\\nsplitting functions.\", \"The class method now also returns the node probability.\", \"Add the stagec data set, used in some tests.\", \"The plot.rpart routine needs to store a value that will be visible\\nto the rpartco routine at a later time.
