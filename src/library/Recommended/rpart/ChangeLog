2013 Sep 01	4.1-3	Document TMT change to predict() output.

2013 Aug 15	4.1-2	Replace calls to as.name().
	                Remove unused and un-exported rpartpl().
	                Correct plot.rpart.Rd as to where things are stored.
	                Increase version dependence to >= 2.15.0,
	                remove conditional paste0 from this package.

2013 Mar 20	4.1-1	Add ko translations, update reference output for 3.0.0.

2012 Nov 29	4.1-0	Remove rpconvert() (converted rpart2 trees).
	
			Clean up a lot of the R code.
	
			C code reformatted with GNU indent and
			-i4 -nut -ncdb -d1 -br -ce -il0 -npcs -brs
			then use whitespace-cleanup in Emacs.

			Call R_CheckUserInterrupts at each phase of
			cross-validation.

			Ensure that surrogates really are better than the
			default split (adj > 1e-10), and that at least 2
			cases of non-zero weight go each way.

			Removed unused file src/s_xpred.c.

2012 Nov 18	4.0-3	Add 'importance' to rpart object and to summary():
	                from TMT.

	                'minlength' arg for tree() method.

	                Improved handling of weights with zero fit,
	                including bugfix for ordered factors.

	                free_tree was commented out in rpart.c, and
	                could crash as the structure was not zeroed.  As a
	                precaution, pointers which are freed are NULLed.

	                s_xpred.c did not free the first instance of a tree.

	                make_cp_list used calloc but did not free.

	                Spell-check help pages and vignettes.

			Several examples needed par(xpd = TRUE) at
			default plotting sizes.

2012 Nov 11	4.0-2	Add car90 dataset from TMT.

	                'agree' in choose_surg.c needs to be double
	                for fractional weights.

	                Not use paste0() so R 2.14.x works.

2012 Oct 26	4.0-1	Merge in updates from TMT: see inst/NEWS.Rd 
	                and Changelog.TMT.

	                Use .Call for all C code.

	                Use an environment in the package for 'parms' from
	                plot.rpart().
