    fails, but it diverges on S and the authors did not notice.


version 1.0-4 1999/11/21
version 1.0-3

    Adjustments for later versions of R (removing functions added here).


version 1.0-2 1999/02/24

    Removed sample, model.response from zzz.R

    Changed attributes(out$spa)$name<- to names(out$spa)<- in saddle.

    Altered test/test-examples to make use of the examples now in R-ex.

    Note that saddle.distn and functions that depend on it (control)
    may fail due to lack of robustness of nlm.


version 1.0-1 1998/07/24

boot/R:

    Many funs store the .Random.seed but that need not exist, so call
    runif(1) first.

    Add missing function union in zzz.R

    Added version of sample that uses prob= in zzz.R

    Replace is.matrix by isMatrix <- function(x) length(dim(x)) == 2
    as R does not think a data frame is a matrix.

    Replace reading of a number in glm.diag.plots by readline.

    Replace nlmin by nlm, with appropriate changes to returned components.
    (This is not wholly successful, as nlm seems less tolerant.)

    Comment out assigns to frame=1.

    split.screen etc are not in R yet: use par(mfrow) in plot.glm.diag and
    layout in plot.boot.

    add drop=F in cv.glm, cens.weird.

    change is.inf to is.infinite.

    change maxit= in glm calls in saddle to calls to control=

boot/data:

    add a dummy rts:  rts <- function(units, name, ...) ts(...)
    to top of bootdata.q

    edit n= to nmax= in scan (carefully: also occurs in lists in scan
    commands).

    add

       for(obj in ls()) save(obj, file = paste(obj, ".rda", sep=""), ascii=T)

    to end of bootdata.q

       R -v 20 --no-save < bootdata.q

    cd4.nested is made by bd.q in the top directory.

boot/man:

    convert files by Sd2Rd. Add data() lines.

boot/test:

    script to test the examples in the help files. Not all will run,
    as far as I know due to things missing in R or nlm not coping
    as well as nlmin.
