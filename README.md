# Rho

The goal of the Rho project is to refactor the interpreter of the R language into a fully-compatible, efficient, VM for R using modern software engineering techniques.  Rho is being carried out independently of the main R development and maintenance effort.

Currently the rho codebase is based off R-devel.

## Build Requirements

Compiling rho requires a GCC or Clang compiler with C++ 11 support and fortran support.  In addition the following libraries must be installed:
   * boost >= 1.48.0
   * libcurl >= 7.28.0
   * zlib >= 1.2.5
   * libbzip2 >= 1.0.6
   * liblzma >= 5.0.3
   * pcre >= 8.10
   * libedit

Compilation of the LLVM JIT requires clang 3.4 or later and the matching
version of the LLVM library.

Rho has been tested to compile on both Linux and Mac OSX systems.

## Configuration and Compilation

To build with the LLVM JIT enabled:
  ```
   configure --enable-llvm-jit --enable-maintainer-mode 
   make
   make check
   ```
For development builds, it is useful to define
`-Wall -DNO_CELLPOOLS -DCHECKED_SEXP_DOWNCAST -fsanitize=address -O1`
in order to find bugs more easily.
